# Reflection Theme for Binary Ninja

> by Jon Palmisciano (@jonpalmisc)

**Reflection is now included with Binary Ninja!** This repository will remain
for historical purposes, but any new issues should be filed under the
[binaryninja-api](https://github.com/Vector35/binaryninja-api) repository.

*Tip: If you have been using a modified version of Reflection, you will have to
change the theme's name in the theme file, as the embedded version will take
precedence over a local copy.*
